Hello! I'm Ioannis, a data scientist with a deep passion for machine learning, generative AI, and computer vision. I earned my Master of Engineering (MEng) in Information and Computer Engineering from the University of Cambridge. Currently, I work at Data Reply UK as a data scientist and consultant, where I leverage my expertise in machine learning and AWS to tackle complex challenges and create innovative solutions for clients.

I’m dedicated to staying current with both academic advancements and industry trends, blending insights from both to achieve optimal results. Feel free to explore my interests further in the [Articles]({{ site.baseurl }}/articles/). I'm always on the lookout for exciting events, intriguing papers, or the latest tech developments. If you have any suggestions, I’d love to hear them :smiley:.

## Data Science/Machine learning
I have a strong interest in many facets of data science and machine learning, from theoretical concepts and statistical/probabilistic modeling to designing and implementing neural network architectures. I'm also passionate about scaling projects and applying best practices to bring procedures and models into production. If you're curious about the concepts and models I experiment with in my spare time, you can check them out in the [Projects]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/) section.

## On a Lighter Note
I enjoy a variety of activities and am always open to trying new ones. Some of my favorites include indoor climbing, hiking, playing pool and clay shooting
